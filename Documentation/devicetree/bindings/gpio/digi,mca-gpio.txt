* Digi GPIO controller for MCA of ConnectCore device tree bindings

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "digi,mca-cc6ul-gpio" or "digi,mca-ioexp-gpio"
- gpio-controller : Marks the device node as a gpio controller.
- interrupt-controller: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.
- interrupt-parent : The phandle for the interrupt controller
- #gpio-cells : Should be two.  The first cell is the pin number and the second
                cell is used to specify the gpio polarity.
- #interrupt-cells : Should be 2.  The first cell is the GPIO number.
                     The second cell bits[3:0] is used to specify trigger type
                     and level flags.

Optional properties:
- pwroff-wakeup-capable-ios : List of MCA IOs that can wakeup the device from
                              power off state. Note that only those IOs that
                              are IRQ capable can wake up the system from low
                              power modes.
                              If the property is not provided, all MCA IOs are
                              configured to wake up the system from power off,
                              if the irq is enabled by the kernel.

Example:

	mca_gpio: gpio {
		compatible = "digi,mca-cc6ul-gpio";
		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		interrupt-parent = <&mca_cc6ul>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		pwroff-wakeup-capable-ios = <0 1>;
	};
