* Digi ConnectCore SOMs Micro Controller Assist tamper support

The MCA Tamper driver allows to detect tamper events.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be one of
  "digi,mca-cc6ul-tamper".
  "digi,mca-cc8x-tamper".

Optional properties:
- tamper-if-list: list of enabled tamper interfaces. Interfaces 0 and 1 are for
		  digital signals while 2 and 3 are for analog comparison. Refer
		  to the documentation for more information on how to use these
		  features.

Example:

	&mca_tamper {
		digi,tamper-if-list = <0 1 2 3>;
	};
